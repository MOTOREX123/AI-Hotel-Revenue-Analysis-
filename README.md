🏨 Hotel Revenue & AI Insights Dashboard – Infosys Internship Project

This project was developed as part of the Infosys Internship Program, with the objective of creating an interactive Hotel Revenue Dashboard that provides end-to-end business insights.

The dashboard consolidates hotel data to display key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:

💰 Total Revenue and Profit

📉 Booking Cancellations

📊 Occupancy and Booking Trends

📈 Upsells and Forecasted Metrics (AI-driven)

Using advanced data analysis and AI techniques, we integrated predictive models to:

Forecast cancellations, enabling better planning and minimizing revenue loss.

Identify upselling opportunities, helping improve overall profit margins.

Analyze trends across different time periods and dimensions.

Make data-driven decisions to optimize revenue strategies.

The dashboard acts as a centralized platform to understand how factors like pricing, booking patterns, and cancellations impact overall business outcomes. It was built to be intuitive, scalable, and capable of integrating with additional AI modules for future enhancements.

This project reflects a practical application of data analytics, business intelligence, and AI integration to solve real-world business challenges in the hospitality domain.
